WebSec Toolbox Chrome Extension

This is a work-in-progress Chrome Extension that adds a right-click context menu to any text boxes, text areas, or input boxes within a web page. Upon clicking the menu, several options are presented, allowing the user to select XSS or mySQL injections to insert into the text box. Upon submitting the form, the user can see if Cross-Site Scripting or mySQL injection vulnerabilities exist on the site.
